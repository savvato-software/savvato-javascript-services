In order to work on and contribute to this project, you will need to fork all Savvato repositories to your
github account. You will also need angular-cli, and the ionic framework to be globally installed on your
system.

Before cloning your forked copies of the repositories, it would be best to create a bit of file structure.
Somewhere on your development machine, create a savvato directory. Inside of your savvato directory, create
a src directory. Inside of your src directory, create a second savvato directory. Inside of that savvato
directory, create a second src directory. Finally, inside of that src directory, create an angular directory.
With that accomplished, you should have a file structure that looks like the following:

savvato
    -src
        -savvato
            -src
                -angular

Inside of the angular directory, clone the savvato-javascript-services and techprofile-component repositories.
Inside of the top level src directory, clone the dtim-techprofile-api, dtim-mobile, and savvato-techprofile-
website repositories.

Finally you should have a file stucture like the following:

savvato
    -src
        -dtim-mobile
        -dtim-techprofile-api
        -savvato
            -src
                -angular
                    -savvato-javascript-services
                    -techprofile-component
        -savvato-techprofile-website

In order to get the project running, it is recommended to begin by building the savvato-javascript-services,
and techprofile-component first, then create your MySQL database, followed by starting up the dtim-techprofile-api,
and finally serving up the dtim-mobile and/or savvato-techprofile-website. The instructions for the setup of
these specific parts will be included in each of their DEVELOPER files.

For this component of the project, create a new dev branch.
Once you have a dev branch you can run the following commands:


    npm ci
    ng build savvato-javascript-services
